# Comic Reader

This is a toy program written by Evan Reynolds. I like reading comics but hate going to 50 different web pages to read each of them, so I wrote this for myself to collect them for me.

It's mostly been written at night in bed, frankly, in brief bursts. It's something I am having fun with and was never meant as a bullet proof industrial application. But I'm having a blast playing in C# again!
